# MvDK2-Code-Template
This template allows for easy custom code injection for Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis on Nintendo DS using [NCPatcher](https://github.com/TheGameratorT/NCPatcher). 

It is pretty bare-bones as of now, but in the future more stuff including symbols may be added/researched.

In the source folder are two examples for accessibility and as a starting point for new users.
## Setup
View [this](https://github.com/MammaMiaTeam/NSMB-Code-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-setup) repository for guides and notes. Setup is the same for this game. (NSMBe + NCPatcher works)
Note: You do not *need* Python 3 and the Nitro SDK since there are no proper headers right now.

Special thanks to the [MammaMiaTeam](https://github.com/MammaMiaTeam) for the layout and template I built this off of.
